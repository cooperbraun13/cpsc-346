## A Simple C Program

* Headers: `#include` inserts standard libraries (e.g., stdio.h) so functions like `printf` are available
* Main function: Every C program starts with main(), which returns an integer exit code and can take command-line arguments (`argc`, `argv`)
* Program output: `printf` writes formatted text to standard output; special characters like `\n` control formatting
* Exit status: `return 0;` signals successful completion to the operating system
